# OMOP data sets
A number of UK data sets have been mapped to the Common Data Model. Information about some of them can be found here.

- The [EHDEN Portal](https://portal.ehden.eu/) includes information about many of the data sets that have been mapped to the CDM by 
[EHDEN Data Partners](https://www.ehden.eu/datapartners/).
- HDR UK's [Innovation Gateway](https://www.healthdatagateway.org/) includes information about many UK health data sets. Some are mapped to OMOP; 
  - [Search for OMOP datasets](https://web.www.healthdatagateway.org/search?search=&conformsTo=Omop&datasetSort=latest&tab=Datasets) using the "conforms to OMOP" filter. (Results depend on metadata completeness)
  - [Cohort Discovery](https://www.healthdatagateway.org/about/cohort-discovery?_gl=1*66ybqo*_ga*MjA0NzQyMjY1LjE2Nzk5OTI5MzM.*_ga_GJ2NS0NB4W*MTY4NDg1ODI4My4zNy4xLjE2ODQ4NTgyOTguNDUuMC4w) tool relies on data sets being transdformed to the OMOP CDM; the Cohort Discovery [Collection](https://web.www.healthdatagateway.org/collection/8627804109041386) lists all the available data sets

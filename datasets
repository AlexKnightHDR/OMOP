# OMOP data sets
A number of UK data sets have been mapped to the Common Data Model. Information about some of them can be found here.

- The [EHDEN Portal](https://portal.ehden.eu/) includes information about many of the data sets that have been mapped to the CDM by [EHDEN Data Partners](https://www.ehden.eu/datapartners/).
